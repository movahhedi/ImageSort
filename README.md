# ImageSort
I always have so many images in my phone. It's a real hassle to categorize them! You can use this code to put them in their place each with a click of a button! Just put all the images directly in the `data/input` folder, open the file through your browser, and click, click, click! Of course, see the folders (albums) afterwards in the `data/output` folder.
You can set the album (button) names in the `data/Albums.json` file as an array.

To start it, run:
```
yarn start
```
