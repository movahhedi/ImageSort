# ImageSort
I always have so many images in my phone. It's a real hassle to categorize them! You can use this PHP code to put them in their place with a click of a button! Just put all the images directly in the `input` folder, open the file through your browser, and click, click, click! of course, see the folders (albums) afterwards in the `output` folder.
You can set the album (button) names in `$Lists` array.

Don't forget to mention the copyright!
